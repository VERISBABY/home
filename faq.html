  <li>The Site may contain links to third parties’ websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those websites. Therefore, please read carefully any privacy policies on those links or websites before either agreeing to their terms or using those websites.</li>
  <li>We may also use Google Analytics to gather statistics on site usage. You acknowledge and accept that we have no control over Google’s data collection. You should look at Google’s privacy policy for details of their data collection practices. Note that, despite the measures taken by us and the third parties we engage, the internet is not secure. As a result, others may nevertheless unlawfully intercept.</li>

    <ul><h4>III.</h4></ul>
    <p>We take what we consider to be appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to reduce the risk of unauthorized or unlawful processing of your personal data and accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your personal data. While no system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by the Site reduce our vulnerability to security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. However, it remains your responsibility:</p>
    <li>where you are a registered user with 'My Account' for the Site.</li>
    <li>to log off or exit from the Site when not using it.</li>
    <li>to ensure no-one else uses the Site while your device is logged on to the Site (including by logging on to your device through a mobile, Wi-Fi or shared access connection you are using).</li>
    <li>to keep your password or other access information secret. Your password and log in details are personal to you and should not be given to anyone else or used to provide shared access for example over a network. You should use a password which is unique to your use of the Site - do not use the same password as you use for another site or email account.</li>
    <li>to maintain good internet security. For example, if your email account is compromised this could allow access to your account with us if you have given us those details and/or permitted access through those accounts. If your email account is compromised it could be used to ask us to reset a password and gain access to your account with us. You should keep all your account details secure. If you think that any of your accounts has been compromised you should change your account credentials with us, and make sure any compromised account does not allow access to your account with us. You should also tell us as soon as you can so that we can try to help you keep your account secure and if necessary warn anyone else who could be affected.</li>

    <ul><h4>IV.</h4></ul>
    <li>PayPal: Easily pay with PayPal by linking to your Credit / Debit Cards / Bank Accounts, accept Giropay payments. For security, you just can use one payment per invoice ID.</li>
    <li>For customised or pre - order products, the Client still have to make full payment in advance like normal orders. Payments are secured with SSL certificate, which ensures that payment pages are encrypted and that data remains confidential.</li>
    <li>Important information: For your security, your billing name and address must match that of the credit card used for payment, except for international credit cards. We reserve the right to cancel any order that does not meet these criteria.</li>
